# 🧠 MindTrack: AI-Powered Mental Health Journal Analyzer

MindTrack is an interactive web app that helps users analyze the emotional tone of their journal entries using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Powered by Streamlit and TextBlob, it provides quick feedback on your mental health trends based on what you write.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📘 **Journal Entry Input** – Type or paste journal entries directly into the app.
- 🎭 **Sentiment Analysis** – Instantly see if your entry is positive, neutral, or negative.
- 📊 **Emotion Scoring** – View polarity and subjectivity scores.
- ⚡ **Fast & Simple** – Built with Python and Streamlit for rapid feedback.

## 🧠 How It Works

MindTrack uses [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) under the hood to:

* Analyze **polarity**: how positive/negative your text is
* Measure **subjectivity**: how subjective or factual your writing feels

These values help provide a rough insight into your emotional state based on your writing.
